{"policy": "Our community is launching the 'VaxUp Neighbors' program, where local volunteers will be trained to have informative conversations about vaccines in familiar settings like our school and park. This initiative, in partnership with the County Health Department and our local PTA, aims to empower residents of all ages, especially parents and young adults, to make informed decisions about vaccination. Volunteers will undergo a comprehensive training program covering various vaccine-related topics, including benefits, safety concerns, and addressing common myths. Through interactive workshops and Q&A sessions, VaxUp Neighbors hopes to increase vaccine awareness, combat misinformation, and ultimately improve public health outcomes in our community. We encourage everyone to get involved.", "vaccine_hesitancy_ratio": [0.3, 0.3, 0.3], "top_5_reasons_for_vaccine_hesitancy": [["distrust_gov", 0], ["dislike_vaccines_generally", 14], ["distrust_vaccines", 0]], "top_5_reasons_for_vaccine_hesitancy_ratio": [0.3333333333333333, 0.3333333333333333, 0.3333333333333333], "swing_agents": []}
