While Linda has worked on the frontlines during the COVID-19 pandemic, she has not yet decided to get vaccinated. She feels hesitant about getting vaccinated due to concerns about potential side effects and the growing mistrust of the pharmaceutical industry. Additionally, she worries about the rushed development of the vaccine and lack of transparency in the testing and validation process. Despite her uncertainty, she recognizes the importance of protecting her patients and plans to continue working in the medical field, even if she decides to forgo getting vaccinated herself.
