275	 Smith is a 28-year-old female who has attained a graduate degree and currently works as a marketing professional.	 Females are more likely to be vaccinated than males in the US. Therefore, Smith fits this category.	 While there is data that demonstrates racial disparities in vaccine acceptance, the COVID-19 pandemic has made white Americans, particularly women, among the first to receive the vaccine. As a white female, Smith is in a category that falls under that.	 Educated individuals are often more likely to be eager to receive the vaccine, as they tend to be better informed about potential health risks and implications. Additionally, a recent study suggests that education level is a significant predictor of beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines. Smith being a graduate is consistent with this trend.	 While older age is a risk factor for severe disease from COVID-19, younger individuals are generally less anxious about receiving the vaccine and its effects. However, it's important to note that recent data suggests that many younger Americans may still have concerns about getting vaccinated, despite their overall lower mortality rates from COVID-19.	 Despite recent research showing some caution among certain industries such as healthcare workers and food service employees, professionals working in white-collar fields, like Smith as a marketing professional, have largely expressed their willingness to receive the vaccine.	 As research suggests, it is a challenge to determine the role that religious affiliation might play in the acceptance or rejection of COVID-19 vaccines, and we must be more diligent in tracking this aspect as individual opinions in this matter span all American values of diversity in these institutions that play a vital role in our nation.
